# Interview-Intel: Predictive Analytics for Interview Status

This machine learning project aimed to revolutionize the hiring process for a large MNC conducting over 1 lakh interviews annually. The goal was to predict interview statuses, providing recruiters with insights into interview sanity and bias detection. 

*The project secured the 2nd prize in hackathon orgainzed by Imarticus Learning in collaboration with KPMG, highlighting its significant impact on the recruitment pipeline.*

## Project Overview

The project focused on leveraging a variety of features, including Speak to Listen Ratios, Average Turn Time, Longest Monologue durations, Silence Ratios, Late Joining Times, Noise Index, Speaking Paces, Live Absence percentages, Question Compliance Ratios, and perceived emotions of both the interviewer and candidate.

## Key Steps Taken

1. **Data Cleaning**: Meticulous cleaning of the dataset to ensure data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables for optimal model performance.

4. **Feature Selection**:
   - SelectKBest
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
   - Random Forest Classifier-based feature importance

5. **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Classifier
   - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

6. **Best-performing Model**: Support Vector Classifier emerged as the top-performing model.

7. **PowerPoint Presentation**: A concise presentation showcasing project methodology and training process.
